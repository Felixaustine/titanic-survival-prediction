# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

I built this project as part of my learning journey in Machine Learning, focusing on understanding the data, training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Problem Statement
Given passenger information such as age, gender, class, and fare, can we predict survival?

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation

## Notebook
You can view and run the notebook here:

## What I Learned
- How to prepare real-world data for ML
- Training and evaluating classification models
- The importance of feature engineering
